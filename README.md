## Learning Objective
**Use Intel hardware and software portfolio and demonstrate the data science process**

Hands-on understanding of building a deep learning model and deploying to the edge
- Use an enterprise image classification problem
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the VMMR dataset
- Choose a framework and network
- Train the model – obtain the graph and weights of the trained network
- Deploy the model on CPU, integrated Graphics and Intel® MovidiusTM Neural Compute Stick

## Training Outline
 1. Intel’s AI Portfolio
   - Hardware: From training to inference with emphasis on 2nd Gen Intel® XeonTM Scalable Processors
   - Software: Frameworks, libraries and tools optimized for Intel® Architecture
   - Community resources: Intel Developer Zone Resources

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Obtain a dataset
   - Explore data visually to understand distribution 
   - Data Reduction and address imbalances
   
 3. Training the models
   - Infrastructure: Intel® AI DevCloud, Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure
   - Process: Prepare and visualize the dataset, prepare for consumption into framework, hyper-parameter tuning, training, validate
   
 4. Model Analysis
   - Check your scores
   - Compare your results
   - Hyper parameter tuning
   - Pick the winner or go back to training
  
 5. Deploy to the edge / Inference
   - Introduction to the Intel® OpenVINOTM Toolkit – Capabilities and benefits
   - Usage Models
   - Model Optimizer – Optimize model, generate hardware agnostic Intermediate Representation (IR) files for prebuilt and custom models 
   - Inference Engine – Deploy to CPU, integrated GPU, FPGA and Intel® MovidiusTM Neural Compute Stick
