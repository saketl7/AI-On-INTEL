## Learning Objective
**Use Intel hardware and software portfolio and demonstrate the data science process**
Hands-on understanding of building a deep learning model and deploying to the edge
- Use an enterprise image classification problem
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the VMMR dataset
- Choose a framework and network
- Train the model – obtain the graph and weights of the trained network
- Deploy the model on CPU, integrated Graphics and Intel® MovidiusTM Neural Compute Stick
